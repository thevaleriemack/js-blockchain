# JavaScript Blockchain Demo

This is a JavaScript implementation of the blockchain concept using Node.js.
Mining is achieved through the use of a cryptographically random nonce.
This example uses a JavaScript Array for simplicity.

This code also uses a custom Node.js server and routing system to keep it as lightweight as possible.

Browserify is used to bundle the blockchain js file.

## Usage

Install node modules

`$ npm install --save`

Run the app!

`$ npm start`
